    For more examples and an user guide, look at this tutorial_.

    .. _tutorial: http://radiativetransfer.org/misc/typhon/doc-trunk/tutorials/fileset.html

    Examples:

        FileSet with multiple files:

        .. code-block:: python

            from typhon.files import FileSet

            # Define a fileset consisting of multiple files:
            files = FileSet(
                path="/dir/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}{minute}{second}.nc",
                name="TestData",
                # If the time coverage of the data cannot be retrieved from the
                # filename, you should set this to "handler" and giving a file
                # handler to this object:
                info_via="filename"
            )

            # Find some files of the fileset:
            for file in files.find("2017-01-01", "2017-01-02"):
                # Should print the path of the file and its time coverage:
                print(file)

        FileSet with a single file:

        .. code-block:: python

            # Define a fileset consisting of a single file:
            file = FileSet(
                # Simply use the path without placeholders:
                path="/path/to/file.nc",
                name="TestData2",
                # The time coverage of the data cannot be retrieved from the
                # filename (because there are no placeholders). You can use the
                # file handler get_info() method with info_via="handler" or you
                # can define the time coverage here directly:
                time_coverage=("2007-01-01 13:00:00", "2007-01-14 13:00:00")
            )

        FileSet to open MHS files:

        .. code-block:: python

            from typhon.files import FileSet, MHS_HDF

            # Define a fileset consisting of multiple files:
            files = FileSet(
                path="/dir/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}{minute}{second}.nc",
                name="MHS",
                handler=MHS_HDF(),
            )

            # Find some files of the fileset:
            for file in files.find("2017-01-01", "2017-01-02"):
                # Should print the path of the file and its time coverage:
                print(file)

        """Initialize a FileSet object.

        Args:
            path: A string with the complete path to the files. The
                string can contain placeholder such as {year}, {month},
                etc. See below for a complete list. The direct use of
                restricted regular expressions is also possible. Please note
                that instead of dots '.' the asterisk '\\*' is interpreted as
                wildcard. If no placeholders are given, the path must point to
                a file. This fileset is then seen as a single file set.
                You can also define your own placeholders by using the
                parameter *placeholder*.
            name: The name of the fileset.
            handler: An object which can handle the fileset files.
                This fileset class does not care which format its files have
                when this file handler object is given. You can use a file
                handler class from typhon.files, use
                :class:`~typhon.files.handlers.common.FileHandler` or write
                your own class. If no file handler is given, an adequate one is
                automatically selected for the most common filename suffixes.
                Please note that if no file handler is specified (and none
                could set automatically), this fileset's functionality is
                restricted.
            info_via: Defines how further information about the file will
                be retrieved (e.g. time coverage). Possible options are
                *filename*, *handler* or *both*. Default is *filename*. That
                means that the placeholders in the file's path will be parsed
                to obtain information. If this is *handler*, the
                :meth:`~typhon.files.handlers.common.FileInfo.get_info` method
                is used. If this is *both*, both options will be executed but
                the information from the file handler overwrites conflicting
                information from the filename.
            info_cache: Retrieving further information (such as time coverage)
                about a file may take a while, especially when *get_info* is
                set to *handler*. Therefore, if the file information is cached,
                multiple calls of :meth:`find` (for time periods that
                are close) are significantly faster. Specify a name to a file
                here (which need not exist) if you wish to save the information
                data to a file. When restarting your script, this cache is
                used.
            time_coverage: If this fileset consists of multiple files, this
                parameter is the relative time coverage (i.e. a timedelta, e.g.
                "1 hour") of each file. If the ending time of a file cannot be
                retrieved by its file handler or filename, it is then its
                starting time + *time_coverage*. Can be a timedelta object or
                a string with time information (e.g. "2 seconds"). Otherwise
                the missing ending time of each file will be set to its
                starting time. If this fileset consists of a single file, then
                this is its absolute time coverage. Set this to a tuple of
                timestamps (datetime objects or strings). Otherwise the period
                between year 1 and 9999 will be used as a default time
                coverage.
            exclude: A list of time periods (tuples of two timestamps) or
                filenames (strings) that will be excluded when searching for
                files of this fileset.
            placeholder: A dictionary with pairs of placeholder name and a
                regular expression matching its content. These are user-defined
                placeholders, the standard temporal placeholders do not have to
                be defined.
            max_threads: Maximal number of threads that will be used to
                parallelise some methods (e.g. writing in background). This
                sets also the default for
                :meth:`~typhon.files.fileset.FileSet.map`-like methods
                (default is 3).
            max_processes: Maximal number of processes that will be used to
                parallelise some methods. This sets also the default for
                :meth:`~typhon.files.fileset.FileSet.map`-like methods
                (default is 8).
            worker_type: The type of the workers that will be used to
                parallelise some methods. Can be *process* (default) or
                *thread*.
            read_args: Additional keyword arguments in a dictionary that should
                always be passed to :meth:`read`.
            write_args: Additional keyword arguments in a dictionary that
                should always be passed to :meth:`write`.
            post_reader: A reference to a function that will be called *after*
                reading a file. Can be used for post-processing or field
                selection, etc. Its signature must be
                `callable(file_info, file_data)`.
            temp_dir: You can set here your own temporary directory that this
                FileSet object should use for compressing and decompressing
                files. Per default it uses the tempdir given by
                `tempfile.gettempdir` (see :func:`tempfile.gettempdir`).
            compress: If true and `path` ends with a compression
                suffix (such as *.zip*, *.gz*, *.b2z*, etc.), newly created
                files will be compressed after writing them to disk. Default
                value is true.
            decompress: If true and `path` ends with a compression
                suffix (such as *.zip*, *.gz*, *.b2z*, etc.), files will be
                decompressed before reading them. Default value is true.
            fs: Instance of implementation of fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem.
                By passing a remote filesystem implementation this allows for
                searching for and opening files on remote file systems such as
                Amazon S3 using s3fs.S3FileSystem.

        You can use regular expressions or placeholders in `path` to
        generalize the files path. Placeholders are going to be captured and
        returned by file-finding methods such as :meth:`find`. Temporal
        placeholders will be converted to datetime objects and represent a
        file's time coverage. Allowed temporal placeholders in the `path`
        argument are:

        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | Placeholder | Description                              | Example    |
        +=============+==========================================+============+

        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | month       | Two digits indicating the month.         | 09         |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | day         | Two digits indicating the day.           | 08         |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | doy         | Three digits indicating the day of       | 002        |
        |             | the year.                                |            |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | hour        | Two digits indicating the hour.          | 22         |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | minute      | Two digits indicating the minute.        | 58         |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | second      | Two digits indicating the second.        | 58         |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+
        | millisecond | Three digits indicating the millisecond. | 999        |
        +-------------+------------------------------------------+------------+

        .. [1] Numbers lower than 65 are interpreted as 20XX while numbers
            equal or greater are interpreted as 19XX (e.g. 65 = 1965,

        All those place holders are also allowed to have the prefix *end*
        (e.g. *end_year*). They represent the end of the time coverage.

        Moreover, you are allowed do define your own placeholders by using the
        parameter `placeholder` or :meth:`set_placeholders`. Their names

        Notes
            This does not constrain the loaded data to the time period given by

        This parallelizes the reading of the files by using threads. This
        should give a speed up if the file handler's read function internally
        uses CPython code that releases the GIL. Note that this method is
        faster than :meth:`icollect` but also more memory consuming.

        Use this if you need all files at once but if want to use a for-loop

                value indicating to which file the function was applied.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that are allowed

        Returns:
            If `return_info` is True, two list are going to be returned:
            one with FileInfo objects of the files and one with the read

                datetime.max per default.
            sort: If true, all files will be yielded sorted by their starting
                and ending time. Default is true.

                object.
            bundle: Instead of only yielding one file at a time, you can get a
                bundle of files. There are two possibilities: by setting this
                to an integer, you can define the size of the bundle directly
                or by setting this to a string (e.g. *1H*),
                you can define the time period of one bundle. See

                When using *bundle*, the returned files will always be sorted
                ignoring the state of the *sort* argument.
            filters: Limits user-defined placeholder to certain values.
                Must be a dictionary where the keys are the names of
                user-defined placeholders and the values either strings or
                lists of strings with allowed placeholder values (can be
                represented by regular expressions). If the key name starts
                with a *!* (exclamation mark), the value represent a black
                list (values that are not allowed).
            no_files_error: If true, raises an NoFilesError when no
                files are found.

        Yields:
            Either a :class:`~typhon.files.handlers.common.FileInfo` object for
            each found file or - if *bundle_size* is not None - a list of

                process, pass it here. The list can contain filenames or lists
                (bundles) of filenames. If this parameter is given, it is not
                allowed to set `start` and `end` then.
            on_content: If true, the file will be read before `func` will be
                applied. The content will then be passed to `func`.
            pass_info: If `on_content` is true, this decides whether also the
                `FileInfo` object of the read file should be passed to `func`.
                Default is false.
            read_args: Additional keyword arguments that will be passed
                to the reading function (see :meth:`read` for more
                information). Will be ignored if `on_content` is False.
            output: Set this to a path containing placeholders or a FileSet
                object and the return value of `func` will be copied there if
                it is not None.
            max_workers: Max. number of parallel workers to use. When
                lacking performance, you should change this number.
            worker_type: The type of the workers that will be used to
                parallelize `func`. Can be `process` or `thread`. If `func` is
                a function that needs to share a lot of data with its
                parallelized copies, you should set this to `thread`. Note that
                this may reduce the performance due to Python's Global
                Interpreter Lock (`GIL <https://stackoverflow.com/q/1294382>`).
            worker_initializer: DEPRECATED! Must be a reference to a function
                that is called once when initialising a new worker. Can be used
                to preload variables into a worker's workspace. See also
                https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool
                for more information.
            worker_initargs: DEPRECATED! A tuple with arguments for
                `worker_initializer`.
            return_info: If true, return a FileInfo object with each return
                value indicating to which file the function was applied.
            error_to_warning: Normally, if an exception is raised during
                reading of a file, this method is aborted. However, if you set
                this to *true*, only a warning is given and None is returned.
                This parameter will be ignored if `on_content=True`.
            **find_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that are allowed
                for :meth:`find` such as `start` or `end`.

        Returns:
            A list with tuples of a FileInfo object and the return value of the
            function applied to this file. If *output* is set, the second
            element is not the return value but a boolean values indicating
            whether the return value was not None.

        Examples:

            .. code-block:: python

                ## Imaging you want to calculate some statistical values from the
                ## data of the files

                    print(file) # prints the FileInfo object
                    print(result) # prints the mean and maximum value

                ## If you need the results directly, you can use imap instead:

                    # immediately ...
                    print(result) # prints the mean and maximum value

            If you need to pass some args to the function, use the parameters
