    Bayesian Monte Carlo Integration

    This class implements methods for solving Bayesian inverse problems using
    Monte Carlo integration. The method uses a data base of atmospheric states
    :math:`x_i` and corresponding observations :math:`\mathbf{y}_i`, which are
    used to compute integrals of the posterior distribution by means of
    importance sampling:

    .. math::

        \int_a^b f(x') p(x' | \mathbf{y}) \: dx' \approx
        \sum_{a \leq x_i \leq b} \frac{w_i(\mathbf{y}) f(x)}
        {\sum_j w_j(\mathbf{y})}.

    The method assumes that measurement uncertainties can be described by a
    multivariate Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix $\mathbf{S}_o$,
    so that the weights :math:`w_i(\mathbf{y})` are given by

    .. math::
        w_i(\mathbf{y}) = \exp
        \{ -\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}_i)^T
        \mathbf{S}_o^{-1} (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}_i) \}.

    The measurements in the database :code:`y` is assumed to be given as an
    array of shape :code:`(n, m)`, where n is the number of cases in the
    database. Currently only scalar retrievals are supported, which means that
    :code:`x` is assumed to a n-element vector containing the retrieval
    quantities corresponding to the observations in :math:`\mathbf{y}`.

    Attributes

        x: numpy.array, shape = (n,)

           in the data base.

            observation uncertainty covariance matrix. Along this vector the
            entries in the database will be ordered, which can be used to
            accelerate the retrieval.

            matrix.
