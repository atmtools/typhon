This subpackage provides functionality to sample posterior distributions of
inverse problems in atmospheric soundings using ARTS as forward model.

The main functionality is implemented by the `MCMC` class which implements
the Metropolis algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution.

In addition to that this subpackage provides a `RandomWalk` class that
simplifies the setup of random walk jump functions as well as diagnostic
function to assess mixing and convergence of the simulations.
