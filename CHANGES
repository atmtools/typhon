Changes in 0.3.5
================

- Fixed writing of zipped XML files.
  When using typhon.arts.xml.save() appending the '.gz' extension to the
  filename now leads to properly zipped files.

- Moved typhon.cm to typhon.plots.cm.
  It is imported automatically when performing

  ```python
  import typhon.plots
  ```

- Adjusted the yellow color in the two qualitative colormaps. They now offer
  more contrast on white background.

- The data array in a GriddedField is now directly subscriptable.
  This makes ``gf[0, 1]`` equivalent to ``gf.data[0, 1]``.

- Added a copy() method to deepcopy GriddedFields. Also copy attributes when
  passing them to the constructor.
